I used two classes for this project.

The first class is the salesrecord class.  It creates an object for the sales record.
The sales record object takes user-inputted code from a main method, stores it and processes it
If the user had input incorrect data, the class allows for the user to input correction and then stores and processes it
The private method calctotalamount is used for processing the input values
The public method printsalesrecord outputs the record's values if they are correct.

The second class Fridayproject is the class with the main method. 
It procedurally takes the user input and stores it in the created objects and then uses the methods to print the record.
If the user desires, they may input and print another record.
